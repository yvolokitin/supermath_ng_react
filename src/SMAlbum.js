                            SuperMath is designed to help students transition from counting or calculating to recalling the basic arithmetic facts.
                            The timer allows SuperMath to distinguish a recalled answer from a counted or calculated answer.
                            The default three-second mastery threshold is carefully selected to be long enough to type in a recalled answer,
                            but not long enough for the student to comfortably enter a counted or calculated answer.
                            Via Settings, we have added the ability to hide/pause the timer, though student answers are still evaluated.
                            With less time pressure, students may not answer as quickly as they can, potentially resulting in lower scores
                            or slower progress than they might otherwise achieve.
