        'white_body': 'The White level is designed to operate with one-digit numbers in range from 0 to 10 (where 10 is the only one two-digit number exception). The main focus of current level is two basic arithmetic operations: Addition and Subtruction. It starts from the numbers understanding (determination of right secuance and order) and Comparision operations with continuation on Addition and Subtruction. The last programs give kids more challange and drive smart thinking for them.',

        'green_body': 'The Green level is introduced tasks for Multiplication of one digit numbers and more advanced associated operations. Multiplication (often denoted by the cross symbol \'x\') is one of the four elementary mathematical operations of arithmetic, with the others being addition, subtraction and division. The multiplication of whole numbers may be thought as a repeated addition; that is, the multiplication of two numbers is equivalent to adding as many copies of one of them, the multiplicand, as the value of the other one, the multiplier.',
